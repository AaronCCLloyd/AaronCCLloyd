# âœ¨ Aaron's Github Profile âœ¨

Welcome to my GitHub space. Feel free to contribute to or fork any public repositories.
I encourage you to explore and experiment with repositories that pique your interest.

- ðŸ“š These days, I'm particular passionate about and interested in Big Data, where Distributed Systems and Data Streams and data storage operate effectively at scale.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm an advocate of open-source and I'm not wedded to any particular language, technology or framework. Each solution is founded on different motivations, intentions and purposes, so I'm always seeking to use the most appropriate product, service or tool that best qualifies to solve the problem at hand.
- ðŸŒ± You can learn more about me at my website, [BrownBear](https://brown-bear.io/).
